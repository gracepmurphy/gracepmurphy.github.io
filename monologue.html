          I’m the Guy That’s Always Jogging Past Your House in the Morning and I Know for a Fact That I’m Better Than You
      </p>

    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        God, look at you. You’re pathetic. It’s 8:00 AM and you’re in your robe and slippers slugging down the driveway to get the newspaper. Your robe is covered in odd stains and your cup of coffee is almost spilling with every step. Why not just leave the cup inside? What are you trying to prove? The stubble on your face is growing rampant, and it looks rather unprofessional. We exchange a smile. I run past your house every day, might as well be friendly. I slow my pace as I approach you, but I don’t intend on stopping. I plan on jogging in place for the duration of our short conversation.
        </p>
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        “Hey, neighbor!”  
        </p>
        
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        I say, flashing my extremely white teeth at you. You grumble a “good morning” in response. I bet you haven’t even brushed your teeth yet.
        </p>
        
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        “A good morning it is!” </p>
    
        <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        Ha, you fool. I woke up at 5:00 AM. My morning consists of three uncooked eggs and an entire raw fish. Your morning consists of coffee and the comic section. I’m more powerful and determined than you could ever understand. You know nothing about having a “good morning”. You nod in response before you bend down to pick up your newspaper. I check my Fitbit to make sure my heart rate hasn’t dropped too much. I should really leave, but talking to you reminds me of how awesome I am.
        </p>
        
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        “Got any exciting plans today? Maybe you’ll finally get to mowing this lawn! Ha! I’m just pulling your leg, bud.” 
        </p>
         
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        I’m not pulling your leg. Your lawn is as overgrown as your stubble. I’m allowed to judge because I’m the one on a run right now. 
        </p>
    
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        “Well, I gotta jet. I’ll catch you later, neighbor!” 
        </p>
        
     <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        I pick up my speed and change from a stationary jog to a run. My Fitbit tells me that I’ve just hit 10,000 steps so far today. It’s not enough. I need to run more. God, I’m pathetic.
