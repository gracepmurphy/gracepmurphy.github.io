        A Review of the “Stickies” App by Apple
    </p>

    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        The app known as Stickies is available to all Apple Laptop users. Some users opt to not use it, and others may be simply unaware that it even exists. I started using Stickies this past year to help me keep my assignments in order. However, that is all that I choose to use it for. If I have something I want to make a note of, I will use the Notes app. I don’t want my desktop to be crowded with multiple notes that anyone can see when I open my laptop. I have one sticky note that I keep open on the left side of my desktop at all times. I like that it stays open because I am a very “out of sight, out of mind” kind of person. This way, I can slide my open tabs over to the side and quickly check the note. Stickies allows you to make text smaller or larger, bold, italicized, or underlined. You can also change the font style and specific font size. As for the overall look of the note itself, you can change the size of the note easily by dragging the sides and you can choose between six different colors to set as the background of the note. The options are yellow, blue, green, pink, purple, and gray. You can also scroll through a note, meaning you can have more text than can fit on your screen so that the note doesn’t take up your entire desktop. You can export and save your notes to different locations, but I never even bother with those features. I never have the need to export the one note that I have. One negative side of this is that you can’t automatically access your notes via another device like an iPhone. However, it doesn’t take much effort to export it to the Notes app, which provides Apple users with iCloud access across different devices. Stickies is a simple app that I use for simple things, and in that aspect, it works great! I wouldn’t recommend it for writing essays with or for writing your darkest secrets in, but if you want a little sticky note available for you easily to see, then Stickies is for you! Stickies is a very simple app and I think that more Apple users should take advantage of it. The best part about it is that it’s completely free and already downloaded on Apple laptops. Unfortunately for non-Apple users, this specific app is not available.
