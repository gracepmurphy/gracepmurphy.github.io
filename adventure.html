         As a child, I loved eating scrambled eggs. My mom liked that I was eating eggs because she was always worried that my brothers and I were never getting enough protein; this eventually led to her adding protein powder into our pancake mix without telling us (I think it was a smart move considering how picky my brothers and I were). Though, I just cannot remember why I liked eating eggs. I can’t stand the texture of any type of eggs anymore, but I really wish I could because I’m probably not getting enough protein and eggs are easy to cook. I’ve heard that the more you try a food, the more likely you are to start liking it. So theoretically, I just need to eat eggs repeatedly until I can trick myself into liking them again. This was the mindset that I had on my trip to England with my boyfriend, Luke. This would be my second time going to England and my second time staying at his grandma’s house (I’ll be referring to her as Grandma Marina throughout the rest of this story). Now, I was determined to make a good impression on Grandma Marina for two reasons:
    </p>
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        1. Grandma Marina is the sweetest person I have ever met. Genuinely just a beautiful ray of sunshine that wants you to be happy, comfortable, and well-fed.
    </p>
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        2. The first time I stayed at her house I got food poisoning after eating shrimp and threw up for a day straight. Unfortunately, there was no time to redeem myself because we had to fly home the next day. 
    </p>

    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        We arrived at Grandma Marina’s house and she was absolutely overjoyed to see me and Luke. Thankfully, the night went really well. We had beef pot pie for dinner and watched British reality TV in the living room. The trouble came the next morning. Grandma Marina had made bacon, toast, and… eggs. She had left it on the table and was sitting watching TV about ten feet away from us. My toast and bacon were already topped with a runny egg. Oh, god. My least favorite type of egg. It just looks uncooked and raw. The thought of eating the slimy goop in front of me made me want to throw up for another 24 hours straight. The toast and bacon were already contaminated by the stuff. I sat rigidly in front of the plate and realized I had two choices:
    </p>

    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        1. I could refuse the food that Grandma Marina had taken the time out of her morning to make for us. Which would probably have been so incredibly embarrassing that I wouldn’t have been able to show my face for the rest of the week. 
    </p>

        OR
    </p>
    
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        2. I could grow up and eat some goddamn eggs. 
    </p>

    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;text-indent:30px;">
        I looked at Luke with fear in my eyes as I picked up my slab of toast; he was well aware of my dislike for eggs and I was well aware of his love for them. Yolk was quick to drip all over my hands and my plate. It was warm and made me shudder. The smell of eggs is definitely not my favorite, but the smell of the bacon was overpowering it. I had to be brave. I had to do this. Maybe I would like it? What if I took a bite and immediately threw up all over the table? No - I didn’t have time to be thinking like this. The yolk was still dripping down my hands and the weight of it all was starting to crack the toast. It was game time. Now or never. I brought the toast to my mouth and tried not to gag at the thought of how slimy this egg was. I took a bite and the egg continued to run. The egg was just as unbearable as I had imagined. I had to chew. It was like eating mucus. Chewing. Okay thank god, it’s down the hatch. Luke looked at me in astonishment through ravenous bites of his own eggs on toast. I could tell he was proud of me. He gave me a smile, wiped the yolk off his face with a napkin, and moved our plates around so it looked like my plate was his own. I could have spoken up and asked for something else instead because, let’s be honest, Grandma Marina would have been completely understanding, but I chose to try it and have a small adventure. Maybe the next time I try eggs, I might actually like them.
